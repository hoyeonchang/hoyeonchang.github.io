<br />

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST Graduate School of AI. I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). Before KAIST, I obtained a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Biological Sciences at Seoul National University.

My academic goal is to understand how intelligent systems acquire and process knowledge from complex patterns, and develop systems that could perform robust variable binding and compositional reasoning. Specifically, my recent focus lies in analyzing language models to understand how they represent and utilize compositional knowledge. I am open and passionate about studying and integrating concepts from other fields involved in studying intelligence and knowledge (computational neuroscience, complex systems, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, etc.) to deepen my understanding of intelligent systems.
