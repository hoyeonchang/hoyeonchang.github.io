<div style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST Graduate School of AI. I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). Before KAIST, I obtained a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Biological Sciences from Seoul National University.
My academic goal is to understand how intelligent systems acquire knowledge from complex patterns, and develop systems that can perform systematic compositional reasoning. I am passionate about integrating concepts from other fields related to intelligence (cognitive science, philosophy, linguistics, etc.) to deepen my understanding of AI.

Outside of research, I am a jazz pianist and occasionally perform at jazz clubs in Seoul.
